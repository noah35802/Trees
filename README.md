# Trees
## Terminologies used in trees:

    Root: The topmost node of a tree is called the root. There is no edge pointing to it, but one or more than one edge originating from it. Here, A is the root node.
    
    Parent: Any node which connects to the child. Node which has an edge pointing to some other node. Here, C is the parent of H.
    
    Child: Any node which is connected to a parent node. Node which has an edge pointing to it from some other node. Here, H is the child of C.
    
    Siblings: Nodes belonging to the same parent are called siblings of each other. Nodes B, C and D are siblings of each other, since they have the same parent node A.
    Ancestors: Nodes accessible by following up the edges from a child node upwards are called the ancestors of that node. Ancestors are also the parents of the parents of …… that node. Here, nodes A, C and H are the ancestors of node I.

    Descendants: Nodes accessible by following up the edges from a parent node downwards are called the descendants of that node. Descendants are also the child of the child of …… that node. Here, nodes H and I are the descendants of node C.

    Leaf/ External Node: Nodes which have no edge originating from it, and have no child attached to it. These nodes cannot be a parent. Here, nodes E, F, G and I are leaf nodes.
    
    Internal node: Nodes with at least one child. Here, nodes B, D and C are internal nodes.
    
    Depth: Depth of a node is the number of edges from root to that node. Here, the depth of nodes A, C, H and I are 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
